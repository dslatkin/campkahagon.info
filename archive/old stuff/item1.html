<h2>Official "ALMA MATER"</h2>
Summer season is over.  
Camping days now are done.
And within our heart, how we hate to part.
From our own Camp Kahagon.
All the days we have spent here.  
All the hours of fun.
Now it’s time to leave, but our hearts will grieve.
For our own Camp Kahagon.
But tho?we go, this much we know.  
We will return some day.
And until we do, we will think of you.
And each night we will pray.
That we’ll soon be together.  
Reunited as one.
‘Til our dreams come true we will pine for you.
And the days spent at Kahagon.
</pre>



<pre class="item" style="display:block;">
<h2>Official "PARTING SONG"</h2>
Camp Kahagon you will be our fondest memory.
Through the years of harmony.  
Happy with you.
Memories of White and Blue.  
And with all our friends so true.
Through the years come back anew.
Kahagon, here’s to you.
