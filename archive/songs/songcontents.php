Summer season is over.  
Camping days now are done.
And within our heart, how we hate to part.
From our own Camp Kahagon.
All the days we have spent here.

For our own Camp Kahagon.
But tho?we go, this much we know.  
We will return some day.
And until we do, we will think of you.
And each night we will pray.
That we�ll soon be together.  
Reunited as one.
�Til our dreams come true we will pine for you.
And the days spent at Kahagon.

<pre>
Give a cheer, Give a cheer.  
Camp Kahagon, we are here.
And we're aiming to be the best in town.
We are right; we are tough.
We don't take no other stuff.
We're the best team there is to be found.
So it's fight, fight, fight and fight with all your might.
Count off your numbers loud and clear...1, 2
When the war is done, you'll know that we have won.
Camp Kahagon - the Blue Moons are here!!
