<p>Hi all... Welcome back to CAMP KAHAGON!</p>

<blockquote>KAHAGON is Iroquois - meaning "In the forest"</blockquote>

<p>
	AAH, if only we really could be there, right?!! Wouldn't it be wonderful to go back and enjoy
	those carefree days (sure didn't appreciate how carefree they were till we got older, eh?!!)
	filled with fun, friends, and, yes... even teenage "angst!"
</p>

<p>
	So many great and vivid memories...Uncle Bill and Aunt Mary; Uncle Bert and Aunt Rose, Bernie
	Savits, Adventure Week, Color War "break", Friday night services or movies on the tennis courts,
	playing jacks on the bunk deck when it was raining, girls wearing rollers and "schmatas" on their
	heads to the dining room, singing a cappella songs when hanging around the benches on the gravel
	walk heading up to the dining room, the Canteen hangout under the rec room, waiter food fights,
	the dell (canoeing, Color War "sing"), the "make-out" area by the bushes on the path between the
	girls and boys camp; getting caught on raids to boys bunks at 3 am, Coronation, trips to the
	Lambertsville theater, Dublin Fair, and Smitty's Diner; Mary's hoagie shop and the quarries...
	etc. etc.
</p>

<p>
	Well, after thinking for years I was the only one who reflected, remembered, or cared, I am
	thrilled to have now found a whole community of Kahagonites who seem to feel similarly. I'm also
	lucky that I have remained friends with some I met at Kahagon when we were only 11 -15 years old,
	and now am happy to discover those of you who are re-surfacing via the internet.
</p>

<p>
	I created this site (with my photos, memories, and info I had kept all these years), with hopes it
	will bring a smile, laugh, and some delightful nostalgic emotions! I was only at Kahagon '62-66
	(the last year of its existence), and know there's many of you who came before...and I'm sure we'd
	all like to hear the stories and reminiscences throughout its history (when did Kahagon actually
	begin?; what really happened to the Krebs'?).
</p>

<p>
	My wish is that this be a useful and joyful means of reconnecting, finding, and staying in touch
	with long lost friends and loves. If you're willing, it would be great to also have and share your
	pix and recollections. So, just let me know and I'll have the webmaster upload. Well, we seem to
	have the ball rolling, and it looks like there will be reunions coming up. So...stay tuned... take
	a look around...and...remember...
</p>

<p>CAMP KAHAGON you are...OUR FONDEST MEMORY!!</p>

<p>Best, peace, aloha and shalom, Saryl</p>
