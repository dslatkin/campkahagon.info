        And within our heart, how we hate to part.<br />

        Now it's time to leave, but our hearts will grieve.<br />
        For our own Camp Kahagon.<br />
        But though we go, this much we know.<br />
        We will return some day.<br />
        And until we do, we will think of you.<br />
        And each night we will pray.<br />
        That we'll soon be together.<br />
        Reunited as one.<br />
        'Til our dreams come true we will pine for you.<br />

    <h3>White Spirit Alma Mater Song (to the tune of "Smile")</h3>
    <p>
        Smile though the summer's ending;<br />
        Sing with your voices blending.<br />
        Though we are drifting apart we will start—<br />
        to sing and to give to you our thoughts of dear White & Blue<br />
        And, with a tear in every eye— we say……<br />
        (to tune of "Sabbath Prayer")<br />
        Camp Kahagon standing in glory—we will be eternally true.<br />
        We stand before you now And pledge our loyalty to you.<br />
        Our golden fields and blue skies remind us<br />
        of happy summer days spent with you.<br />
        We thank you for the aura of friendship,<br />
        which ever shall unite as one.<br />
        Our hearts are filled pride; honor to abide;<br />
        devotion grows inside for you. And….<br />
        (back to "Smile")<br />
        Friendships will last forever.<br />
        Remembering the past forever.<br />
        Though we are parting, our future's just starting.<br />
        The time seemed to fly, Kahagon<br />
        Memories go by, Kahagon.<br />
        And, with a tear in every eye—we say, Goodbye!

        />
        Spirit at night, hearts burning bright;<br />
        As we give our praise to white team, searching forward<br />
        Our goal is said, our voices shouting outward, victory is met<br />
        Hail to the white; best team in sight. Hear our battle cry.<br />
        Each heart will beat in triumph; a sound that victory is night<br />
        A bulging out like warriors, will conquer do or die.<br />
        You see a many markings (?) ---(clap, clap) upon a voyage tonight.<br />
        Destroy the mighty blue team fleet and win with WHITE..da da dum…<br />
